# PartnAR

**PartnAR** is an innovative Augmented Reality (AR) business card system integrated with a Content Management System (CMS). The system provides an interactive way to present employee information, allowing traditional business cards to serve as markers that trigger engaging AR content when scanned.  

This project was designed to enhance professional networking and organizational representation by bridging physical business cards with dynamic digital content. With the CMS, administrators can easily update employee details, ensuring information remains current without the need to reprint cards.
